.SH NAME
ovs\-vswitchd \- Open vSwitch daemon
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ovs\-vswitchd
\fIconfig\fR
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
A daemon that manages and controls any number of Open vSwitch switches 
on the local machine.
.PP
The mandatory \fIconfig\fR argument specifies a configuration file.
For a description of \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR configuration syntax, see
\fBovs\-vswitchd.conf\fR(5).
.PP
At startup or upon receipt of a \fBSIGHUP\fR signal, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR
reads the configuration file.  It sets up Open vSwitch datapaths and then 
operates switching across each bridge described in its configuration 
files.  If a logfile was specified on the command line it will also 
be opened or reopened.
.PP
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR switches may be configured with any of the following 
features:
.
.IP \(bu
L2 switching with MAC learning.
.
.IP \(bu
NIC bonding with automatic fail-over and source MAC-based TX load
balancing ("SLB").
.
.IP \(bu
802.1Q VLAN support.
.
.IP \(bu
Port mirroring, with optional VLAN tagging.
.
.IP \(bu
NetFlow v5 flow logging.
.
.IP \(bu
Connectivity to an external OpenFlow controller, such as NOX.
.
.PP
Only a single instance of \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is intended to run at a time.
A single \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR can manage any number of switch instances, up
to the maximum number of supported Open vSwitch datapaths.
.PP
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR does all the necessary management of Open vSwitch datapaths
itself.  Thus, external tools, such \fBovs\-dpctl\fR(8), are not needed for
managing datapaths in conjunction with \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR, and their use
to modify datapaths when \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is running can interfere with
its operation.  (\fBovs\-dpctl\fR may still be useful for diagnostics.)
.PP
An Open vSwitch datapath kernel module must be loaded for \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR
to be useful.  Please refer to the \fBINSTALL.Linux\fR file included in the
Open vSwitch distribution for instructions on how to build and load
the Open vSwitch kernel module.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB--fake-proc-net\fR"
Causes \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR to simulate some files in \fB/proc/net/vlan\fR
and \fB/proc/net/bonding\fR that some legacy software expects to
exist.  This option should only be used if such legacy software is
actually in use.  It requires the \fBbrcompat_mod.ko\fR kernel module
to be loaded.

.SH "RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS"
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) can send commands to a running
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR process.  The currently supported commands are
described below.  The command descriptions assume an understanding of
how to configure Open vSwitch, as described in
\fBovs-vswitchd.conf\fR(5).
.SS "OVS\-VSWITCHD COMMANDS"
These commands manage the \fBovs-vswitchd\fR process.
.IP "\fBvswitchd/reload\fR"
Reloads the \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR configuration file, as if a
\fBSIGHUP\fR signal were received.  The command completes only after
reloading is finished, in particular after all datapaths have been
created and destroyed and ports added and removed as specified by the
new configuration.
.SS "BRIDGE COMMANDS"
These commands manage bridges.
.IP "\fBfdb/show\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Lists each MAC address/VLAN pair learned by the specified \fIbridge\fR,
along with the port on which it was learned and the age of the entry,
in seconds.
.
.IP "\fBbridge/dump-flows\fR \fIbridge\fR"
Lists all flows in \fIbridge\fR, including those normally hidden to
commands such as \fBovs-ofctl dump-flows\fR.  Flows set up by mechanisms
such as in-band control and fail-open are hidden from the controller
since it is not allowed to modify or override them.
.SS "BOND COMMANDS"
These commands manage bonded ports on an Open vSwitch's bridges.  To
understand some of these commands, it is important to understand a
detail of the bonding implementation called ``MAC hashing.''  Instead
of directly assigning Ethernet source addresses to slaves, the bonding
implementation computes a function that maps an 48-bit Ethernet source
addresses into an 8-bit value (a ``MAC hash'' value).  All of the
Ethernet addresses that map to a single 8-bit value are then assigned
to a single slave.
.IP "\fBbond/list\fR"
Lists all of the bonds, and their slaves, on each bridge.
.
.IP "\fBbond/show\fR \fIport\fR"
Lists all of the bond-specific information about the given bonded
\fIport\fR: updelay, downdelay, time until the next rebalance.  Also
lists information about each slave: whether it is enabled or disabled,
the time to completion of an updelay or downdelay if one is in
progress, whether it is the active slave, the MAC hashes assigned to
the slave, and the MAC learning table entries that hash to each MAC.
.IP "\fBbond/migrate\fR \fIport\fR \fIhash\fR \fIslave\fR"
Assigns a given MAC hash to a new slave.  \fIport\fR specifies the
bond port, \fIhash\fR either the MAC hash to be migrated (as a decimal
number between 0 and 255) or an Ethernet address to be hashed, and
\fIslave\fR the new slave to be assigned.
.IP
The reassignment is not permanent: rebalancing or fail-over will
cause the MAC hash to be shifted to a new slave in the usual
manner.
.IP
A MAC hash cannot be migrated to a disabled slave.
.IP "\fBbond/set-active-slave\fR \fIport\fR \fIslave\fR"
Sets \fIslave\fR as the active slave on \fIport\fR.  \fIslave\fR must
currently be enabled.
.IP
The setting is not permanent: a new active slave will be selected
if \fIslave\fR becomes disabled.
.IP "\fBbond/enable-slave\fR \fIport\fR \fIslave\fR"
.IQ "\fBbond/disable-slave\fR \fIport\fR \fIslave\fR"
Enables (or disables) \fIslave\fR on the given bond \fIport\fR, skipping any
updelay (or downdelay).
.IP
This setting is not permanent: it persists only until the carrier
status of \fIslave\fR changes.
.IP "\fBbond/hash\fR \fImac\fR"
Returns the hash value which would be used for \fImac\fR.
