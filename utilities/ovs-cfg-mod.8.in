.SH NAME
ovs\-cfg\-mod \- Safely manage a ovs\-vswitchd.conf\-style configuration file
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB ovs\-cfg\-mod \fR[\fB\-T \fItimeout\fR] \fB\-F \fIfile\fR
[\fIaction\fR] [\fIaction\fR...\fR]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
A program for managing a \fovs\-vswitchd.conf\fR(5)\-style configuration
file.  \fBovs\-cfg\-mod\fR uses the same locking mechanisms as
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR and its related utilities.  This allows it to be
run safely on ``live'' configurations.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Specifying the Configuration File"
.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR \fItimeout\fR
.IQ "\fB\-\-timeout=\fItimeout\fR
By default, \fBovs\-cfg\-mod\fR will wait forever to lock the
configuration file specified on \fB\-F\fR or \fB\-\-config\-file\fR.  This
option makes \fBovs\-cfg\-mod\fR wait no more than \fItimeout\fR
milliseconds to obtain the lock, after which it exits unsuccessfully.
.
If it is present, this option must be specified before \fB\-F\fR or
\fB\-\-config\-file\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR \fIfile\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-config\-file=\fIfile\fR"
Use \fIfile\fR as the configuration file to query or modify.
.
This option is required.  It must be specified before any action
options.
.
.SS "Specifying Actions"
A series of one or more action options may follow the configuration
file options.  These are executed in the order provided and under a
single lock instance, so they appear atomic to external viewers of
\fIfile\fR.
.
As discussed in \fBovs\-vswitchd.conf\fR(5), each line in the
configuration file consists of a key\-value pair.  Actions generally
take either a \fIkey\fR or \fIentry\fR argument.  A \fIkey\fR is a
dot\-separated description of a configuration option.  A \fIentry\fR is
a key\-value pair, separated by the \fB=\fR sign.
.
The following actions are supported:
.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR \fIentry\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-add=\fIentry\fR"
Add \fIentry\fR to \fIfile\fR.  Please note that duplicates are
allowed, so if a unique key is required, a delete must be done first.
.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fIentry\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-del\-entry=\fIentry\fR"
Delete \fIentry\fR from \fIfile\fR.  Deletes only the first entry 
that matches \fIentry\fR.  
.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIkey\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-del\-section=\fIkey\fR"
Delete section \fIkey\fR from \fIfile\fR.  
.
.IP "\fB\-\-del\-match=\fIpattern\fR"
Deletes every entry that matches the given shell glob \fIpattern\fR.
For example, \fB\-\-del\-match=bridge.*.port=*\fR deletes all the ports
from every bridge, and \fB\-\-del\-match=bonding.bond0.*\fR is equivalent
to \fB\-\-del\-section=bonding.bond0\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR \fIkey\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-query=\fIkey\fR"
Queries \fIfile\fR for entries that match \fIkey\fR.  Each matching
value is printed on a separate line.  Duplicates will be printed
multiple times.  
.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-changes\fR"
Logs all of the changes made to the configuration file in a ``unified
diff''\-like format.  Only actual changes are logged, so that if, for
example, a \fB\-\-del\-match\fR action did not match any key\-value pairs,
then nothing will be logged due to that action.  Furthermore, only the
net effects of changes are logged: if a key\-value pair was deleted and
then an identical key\-value pair was added back, then nothing would be
logged due to those changes.
.
This action logs changes that have taken effect at the point where it
is inserted.  Thus, if it is given before any other action, it will
not log any changes.  If \fB\-\-changes\fR is given more than once,
instances after the first log only the changes since the previous
instance.
