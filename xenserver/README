This directory contains files for seamless integration of vswitch on
Citrix XenServer hosts managed by the Citrix management tools.

Some of these files are modifications of Citrix's proprietary code.
Citrix has given permission to distribute these modified files.
Citrix has not specified a particular license for them.  There is no
guarantee that, should Citrix specify a license, that it would be
DFSG-compliant or GPL-compatible.

Most of the files in this directory is installed on a XenServer system
under the same name, if underscores are replaced by slashes.  The
files are:

    etc_init.d_vswitch

        Initializes the vswitch at boot and shuts it down at shutdown.

    etc_init.d_vswitch-xapi-update

        Init script to ensure vswitch-cfg-update is called for the
        current host at boot.

    etc_logrotate.d_vswitch

        Ensures that /var/log/ovs-vswitchd.log is rotated periodically
        and that ovs-vswitchd reopens its log file at that point.

    etc_profile.d_vswitch.sh

        vswitch-related shell functions for the administrator's
        convenience.

    etc_xapi.d_plugins_vswitch-cfg-update

        xapi plugin script to update the cache of configuration items
        in the ovs-vswitchd configuration file that are managed in the
        xapi database when integrated with Citrix management tools.

    etc_xensource_scripts_vif

        vswitch-aware replacement for Citrix script of the same name.

    opt_xensource_libexec_interface-reconfigure

        vswitch-aware replacement for Citrix script of the same name.

    root_vswitch_scripts_dump-vif-details

        Script to retrieve extended information about VIFs that are
        needed by the controller.  This is called by the "vif" script,
        which is run when virtual interfaces are added and removed.

    usr_share_vswitch_scripts_refresh-xs-network-uuids

        Script to refresh bridge.<bridge>.xs-network-uuids keys, which
        can get out-of-sync following a pool join.  Running this script
        is an alternative to rebooting the host.

    root_vswitch_scripts_sysconfig.template

        Template for vswitch's /etc/sysconfig/vswitch configuration
        file.

    usr_lib_xsconsole_plugins-base_XSFeatureVSwitch.py

        xsconsole plugin to configure the pool-wide configuration keys
        used to control vswitch when integrated with Citrix management
        tools.

    usr_sbin_brctl

        wrapper for /usr/sbin/brctl that provides some additional
        bridge compatibility

    usr_sbin_xen-bugtool

        vswitch-aware replacement for Citrix script of the same name.

    vswitch-xen.spec

        spec file for building RPMs to install on a XenServer host.

To install, build the vswitch RPM with a command like this:

        rpmbuild -D "vswitch_version $full_version" \
                -D "xen_version $XENKERNEL" \
                -D "build_number --with-build-number=$buildnr" \
                -bb vswitch-xen.spec

Then, "rpm -U" the resulting vswitch package on the XenServer hosts in
question and reboot them.  (The vswitch-dbg package that is also
produced need not be installed, but it is harmless to do so.)
