Building with gcov support
==========================

The Open vSwitch "configure" script supports the following
code-coverage related options:

  --disable-coverage
  --enable-coverage=no

    Do not build with gcov code coverage support.

    This is the default if no coverage option is passed to
    "configure".

  --enable-coverage
  --enable-coverage=yes

    Build with gcov code coverage support, but do not assume that any
    coverage-related tools are installed and do not add special
    coverage support to the test suite.

  --enable-coverage=lcov

    Build with gcov code coverage support, as above, but also add
    support for coverage analysis to the test suite.  Running "make
    check" will produce a directory "tests/coverage.html" in the build
    directory with an analysis of the test suite's coverage.

    This setting requires the lcov suite of utilities to be installed.
    The "lcov" and "genhtml" programs from lcov must be in PATH.  lcov
    is available at: http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php
